- ðŸ–¥ I am working as senior data scientist at Ixora Solution Ltd.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Dirichlet decomposition (you won't probably find it in google search because I defined it and it does not seem to be well established) and how to use it to estimate partial sum of multiplicative functions.
- :book: Iâ€™m currently learning number theory, at the moment, Sieve Theory.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on a number of things, e.g. https://github.com/math-projects/inequality or https://github.com/proafxin/football_manager. Feel free to reach out to me if you are interested in collaborating.
- ðŸŒ± I like LaTeX a lot. I created this class to make documents look antique like it was written in 18/1900s. Check it out here: https://github.com/proafxin/antique_book Sometimes I like writing some packages e.g. I created https://github.com/proafxin/df_to_db to write pandas dataframes to databases directly using credential without creating a database engine internally every time.
